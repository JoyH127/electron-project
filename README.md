I was making express API which connects to local SQLite, however
Changed into native API for security reasons. 

Finally, I can directly render the database with my testing data. 
However, there are a few errors with React. 

Next goal.. 
- structuring URL and project data 
- CRUD 
- JSON login or session cookie 
- CSS frameworks.
